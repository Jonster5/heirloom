Once in power, the MNR quickly began to make many radical changes to Bolivian 
policy and society at large. The MNR greatly improved the Bolivian economy by 
increasing the amount of financial support it got from the USA, cutting down on
inflation, nationalizing the mining industry as well as the various oil 
companies based in the country. The MNR was also renowned for implementing 
universal voting rights to all citizens of Bolivia, reducing the size and 
budget of the military, and nationalizing all farmland to increase 
productivity. However the MNR wasnâ€™t without its faults. During its time in 
power, it was criticized for trying to push fascist ideologies on the citizens
of Bolivia, for being internally divided amongst its key leaders, and making 
great efforts to make Bolivia appear as though it was prospering despite many
major cities such as La Paz existing primarily in a state of deep poverty.
