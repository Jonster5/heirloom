Paz Estenssoro and Hernán Siles Zuazo had founded the MNR together, however 
over time they had grown to distrust each other. After Siles served as 
president from 1956 to 1960, Paz was worried about Siles winning the election 
a second time, as popular support for him was very high. Paz, seeing this as 
a threat to his power and ambitions, decided to remove Siles from the running. 
Siles and any of those within the MNR loyal to him, were all exiled from the 
country and put on the equivalent of a “most wanted” list. Paz Estenssoro won 
the 1960 election, but now the party and government had been significantly 
weakened, and the people of Bolivia had begun to lose trust in the MNR upon 
discovering the scale of the infighting.
