After a steadily rising in power and influence since their creation in 1942, 
the MNR was finally in a position to take control of the government. In 1952 
miners all around the country, with the support of the FSTMB and MNR, seized 
weapons from arsenals and started advancing on major cities like La Paz and 
Sucre. After brief battles through the streets of La Paz, the army surrendered
after suffering 600 casualties to the armed miners. With this victory, the MNR 
installed a new government, with Paz Estenssoro as president.
