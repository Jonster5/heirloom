After news got out about Hernan Siles’ disappearance, a large portion of 
remaining influential members of the MNR party took a great dislike towards
Paz Estenssoro. For the entirety of Estenssoro’s second presidency, the MNR 
was consumed by internal strife, eroding the authenticity of the entire 
Bolivian government. At the end of his presidency, the military staged a 
coup and overthrew the MNR, spelling its end. After this, the military 
controlled the government for some time, but eventually democracy resumed in
the country.
