In the late 1890s and early 1900s the tin mining industry began to become 
extremely profitable. Large corporations formed entirely around mining tin and 
exporting it to other countries around the world. Countries such as the United 
States, Great Britain, and several other European and Asian powers began to 
start buying more tin from Bolivia. America in particular began to source the 
vast majority of its tin from Bolivian corporations. The Bolivian government 
took advantage of this by instituting export taxes as well as a tax on mining 
tin. However the miners themselves, especially the large numbers of indigenous 
people working in the mines, often were subjected to horrible conditions, low 
pay, and long working hours.
