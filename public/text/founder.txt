In June of 1942, the Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario, or Revolutionary 
Nationalist Movement in english, was founded by its future Presidents, Paz 
Estenssoro and Hernán Siles Zuazo. The MNR was considered by many to be very 
radical and progressive, while simultaneously being semi-fascist in nature. 
Support for it grew rapidly throughout Bolivia all through the 1940s as the MNR 
promised major changes in Bolivia’s social structure. Two years after the MNR 
was founded, the Syndical Federation of Bolivian Mineworkers (FSTMB) was 
established by the mining communities in Bolivia. They became the largest and 
most influential labor organization in Bolivia, and began to work closely with 
the MNR.
